# @dtinth’s custom Tailwind build

For use in my own projects… This is Tailwind CSS plus:

- My color palette. I have used these colors over the years, and find no need to give them names. My muscle memory has been trained to type out these color codes already, and some colors have been chosen to be easy to type. Therefore, they will be referred to by their **hex color code**, e.g. `bg-#353433 text-#e9e8e7`.

  As my personal palette is very limited, Tailwind CSS’ color palettes stay intact.

- My font stack.

## Versioning

This project has its own versioning, and does not follow Tailwind’s versioning.
